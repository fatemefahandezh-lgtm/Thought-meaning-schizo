In A User's Guide to Thought and Meaning by Ray Jackendoff, Part Four: Rationality and Intuition (which corresponds to your request for "Season 4") explores the relationship between conscious reasoning and unconscious mental processes.
The following key details are covered in this final section:
The Nature of Rational Thought
 * Rational Thinking as "Inner Speech": Jackendoff argues that what we experience as rational thought is actually "phonological handles" (internalized speech) attached to unconscious meanings.
 * The Benefit of Language: While all languages help in similar ways, the primary benefit of language for thought is that it provides a stable, conscious anchor for complex, unconscious concepts, allowing us to manipulate ideas more precisely.
 * Rationality as a Craft: The book suggests that thinking rationally is not an automatic human trait but a "craft" or skill that must be learned and practiced, much like an art or a science.
The Role of Intuition
 * The Dominance of the Unconscious: A major theme is that most of our "thinking" is actually unconscious intuition. Rational thought is described as a "pale reflection" of these deeper, invisible processes.
 * The "Aura" of Meaningfulness: Jackendoff warns that we can sometimes combine words into grammatically correct sentences that create a false "aura" of meaningfulness without actually conveying a coherent thought.
 * Intuition vs. Logic: We often rely on "gut feelings" or "insights" (intuition) to solve problems, only using rational thought afterward to justify or double-check those results.
Rationality's Pitfalls and Potential
 * Limitations of Reason: The section identifies several pitfalls of apparently rational thinking, noting how easily we can be misled by the formal structure of language even when the underlying logic is flawed.
 * Science and the Arts: Jackendoff speculates on how the interaction between rationality and intuition drives human progress in science and creative endeavors.
 * Living with Multiple Perspectives: The book concludes by encouraging the reader to embrace multiple perspectives—such as the "ordinary perspective" of daily life and the "cognitive perspective" of science—recognizing that both are necessary for a full understanding of the human experience.
