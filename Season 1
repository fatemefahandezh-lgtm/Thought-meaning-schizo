Based on the provided book, A User's Guide to Thought and Meaning by Ray Jackendoff, there is no "Season 1" to summarize, as it is a non-fiction book rather than a television series. However, the book is organized into four main parts. Part One: Language, Words, and Meaning functions as the opening section and can be summarized as follows:
Part One: Language, Words, and Meaning
 * The Cognitive Perspective: Jackendoff introduces a "brain's-eye view" of language, focusing on what happens in our heads when we think and speak. He argues that the connection between language and thought is found in meanings.
 * Defining Language: Language is defined as a system of principles called "mental grammar". This system allows a finite brain to produce an unlimited number of novel thoughts and utterances by combining a finite set of words and concepts.
 * The Nature of Words: Words are part of the internal system used to build messages. The book explores how we distinguish "the same word" across different pronunciations or contexts.
 * What is Meaning?: Jackendoff identifies several key properties of meanings:
   * They are hidden from conscious awareness, aside from a general "feeling of meaningfulness".
   * They are preserved in translation between languages.
   * They serve as the basis for reference (connecting to the world) and inference (reasoning).
 * The Unconscious Meaning Hypothesis: A central theme is that thought and meaning are almost completely unconscious. What we experience as conscious thought is often just "phonological handles" (internal speech) attached to unconscious concepts.
 * Language and Thought: The section addresses the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis," questioning whether the specific language one speaks determines how they think.
