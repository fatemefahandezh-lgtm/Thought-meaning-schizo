In A User's Guide to Thought and Meaning by Ray Jackendoff, Part Three: Reference and Truth (which corresponds to the user's request for "Season 3") examines how we use the internal structures of our minds to relate language to the external world.
The Mechanism of Reference
 * Connecting Language to the World: Reference is the function that allows us to use language to talk about things outside our heads. Jackendoff argues that this connection is not a direct link between words and physical objects, but a mental process involving reference files.
 * Reference Files: When we think about an object, our brain creates a "file" in our conceptual structure. This file keeps track of an entity even when it is out of sight, such as a cat running behind a bookcase.
 * Mismatching Reference: In conversation, people often think they are referring to the same thing when they are actually not. These "mismatches" reveal that reference is a subjective mental act rather than an objective, foolproof connection to reality.
Cognitive Metaphysics
 * What Can We Refer To?: Jackendoff introduces "Cognitive Metaphysics" to describe the kinds of entities our minds are capable of referring to. This includes not just physical objects like "puddles" or "tigers," but also abstract concepts like "Tuesday," "justice," or "imaginary friends".
 * Persons as Entities: The book explores how we categorize "persons" differently from other objects. We assign specific character tags to people that involve a sense of their continuity, agency, and internal life.
 * Virtual Entities: We can refer to things that don't exist in the physical world, such as Santa Claus or Sherlock Holmes, by using specific mental "character tags" that mark them as "imaginary" or "fictional".
The Nature of Truth
 * Truth as a Mental Feeling: Rather than being an abstract, external fact, Jackendoff suggests that "truth" is experienced as a feeling of assent, conviction, or congruence.
 * Judging Truth: When we judge a sentence to be true (e.g., "There is a cat on the mat"), our brain monitors the "fit" between the sentence's meaning and our perceptual information. If they align, we experience a sense of "congruence"; if they don't, we feel "dissent" or "incongruence".
 * Ordinary vs. Scientific Truth: The "ordinary perspective" views truth as a simple correspondence between words and the world. However, from a cognitive perspective, truth is a complex internal judgment that can sometimes go wrong—as seen in cases of hallucinations or brain damage where a person firmly believes something that is physically false.
