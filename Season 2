In Ray Jackendoff's book, A User's Guide to Thought and Meaning, "Part Two: Consciousness and Perception" explores the "brain's-eye view" of how we experience our thoughts and the physical world.
The following key themes and details are covered in this section:
The Unconscious Meaning Hypothesis
 * The Experience of Thinking: Jackendoff argues that when we think, we are primarily conscious of "phonological handles"—internalized speech sounds.
 * Hidden Meanings: The actual meaning and the process of connecting thoughts to language are almost entirely unconscious. We only experience the result, which we often label as "intuition" or "insight".
 * Cognitive Correlates: The book identifies three components that must be present for a thought to become conscious: the "handles" of language, a feeling of meaningfulness, and a sense of "aboutness" or reference to the world.
The Mechanics of Perception
 * Seeing vs. Thinking: Part Two draws parallels between how we perceive visual objects and how we "perceive" thoughts.
 * "Seeing As": When we look at an object, such as a fork, the brain doesn't just see shapes; it "sees it as" a specific category. This involves two components: the visual representation and the conceptual meaning attached to it.
 * Spatial Perception: Jackendoff explores how the brain constructs a world that feels "out there," separate from ourselves, through various modalities of spatial perception (sight, touch, etc.).
Other "Feels" in Experience
 * Character Tags: The book introduces the idea of "character tags"—unconscious markers the brain attaches to experiences to give them a certain "feel".
 * Reality vs. Imagination: These tags are what allow us to distinguish between a real object in front of us and a memory or a "virtual" entity like a character in a book.
 * Valuation: Other "feels" include the sense of whether something is familiar, important, or "true".
